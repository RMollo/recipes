INGREDIENTS

-1/2 pound rigatoni
-1/4 pound spicy Italian sausage, casing removed
-2 garlic cloves, thinly sliced
-1 1/2 cups marinara sauce
-1/2 teaspoon dried crushed red pepper
-1/4 cup grated mozzarella cheese
-2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
-1 teaspoon chopped fresh Italian parsley
-Extra-virgin olive oil (to taste)

Directions: 

Boil rigatoni to al dente. Drain. Preheat broiler. Cook sausage in heavy large pot over medium-high heat until no longer pink, stirring frequently and breaking up with back of wooden spoon. Add garlic and sauté until soft, about 2 minutes. Drain off excess oil and return pot to medium-high heat. Stir in marinara sauce and crushed red pepper, then pasta. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Divide pasta among four 1 1/4-cup soufflé dishes or custard cups. Sprinkle mozzarella and Parmesan over. Place in broiler until cheese melts and begins to brown, watching closely to prevent burning, about 1 1/2 minutes. Sprinkle rigatoni with parsley, drizzle with olive oil, and serve.
